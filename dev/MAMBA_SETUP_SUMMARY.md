# Mamba Setup - Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 20, 2024  
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Mamba/Conda Configuration

**File**: `environment.yml`
- Specifies Python 3.11
- Organizes packages by category
- Uses conda-forge channel for optimized packages
- Includes pip-only packages (aisuite, anthropic, etc.)
- Total: ~46 packages across 5 categories

### 2. Created Automated Setup Script

**File**: `scripts/install/setup-mamba.sh`
- Detects mamba or conda
- Creates environment from environment.yml
- Verifies installation
- Configures Jupyter kernel
- Provides helpful error messages
- Executable permissions set

### 3. Updated Documentation

**Files Updated**:
- `docs/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` - Added mamba section as primary method
- `docs/MAMBA_VS_PIP.md` - Comprehensive comparison guide
- `dev/SETUP_STATUS.md` - Updated to reflect mamba as recommended
- `SETUP_README.md` - Prioritized mamba in quick start

### 4. Maintained Backward Compatibility

**Kept**:
- `requirements.txt` - For pip users and CI/CD
- `scripts/install/setup-venv.sh` - For traditional pip/venv workflow
- All existing documentation

## Key Benefits

## Quick Start Commands

### Recommended: Mamba

```bash
# Install miniforge (if needed)
brew install miniforge
conda init zsh
# Restart terminal

# Run setup
./scripts/install/setup-mamba.sh

# Activate
conda activate agentic-ai

# Verify
python --version  # Should show 3.11.x
```

### Alternative: Pip

```bash
# Upgrade Python first
brew install python@3.11

# Run setup
./scripts/install/setup-venv.sh

# Activate
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## What's Different from Pure Pip?

### environment.yml vs requirements.txt

**environment.yml**:
- Specifies Python version
- Uses optimized conda-forge packages
- Can mix conda and pip packages
- Includes environment name
- Better for scientific computing

**requirements.txt**:
- Python version not specified
- All packages from PyPI
- Simpler format
- Better for pure Python projects
- Smaller file size

### Package Sources

**Mamba/Conda**:
- Most packages from conda-forge (pre-compiled)
- Some packages from pip (aisuite, anthropic, etc.)
- Optimized builds for scientific packages

**Pip**:
- All packages from PyPI
- May require compilation
- May need system dependencies

## Testing the Setup

### After Running scripts/install/setup-mamba.sh

```bash
# Activate environment
conda activate agentic-ai

# Check Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.11.x

# Test imports
python -c "
import openai
import fastapi
import jupyter_server
import pandas
import aisuite
print('âœ… All packages working!')
"

# Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook

# Or start FastAPI
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Maintenance

### Update Environment

```bash
# After modifying environment.yml
mamba env update -f environment.yml --prune
```

### Add New Package

```bash
# Option 1: Edit environment.yml, then update
mamba env update -f environment.yml

# Option 2: Install directly (temporary)
conda activate agentic-ai
mamba install package-name

# Option 3: Pip package (if not in conda-forge)
pip install package-name
```

### Export Environment

```bash
# For sharing exact versions
conda env export > environment-lock.yml

# For cross-platform (no builds)
conda env export --no-builds > environment-portable.yml
```

## Comparison with Course Requirements

### Course Provided

```txt
# requirements.txt from course
aisuite==0.1.11
anthropic
openai
fastapi
jupyter
pandas
...
```

### Our Implementation

**environment.yml** (Primary):
- âœ… All course packages included
- âœ… Organized by category
- âœ… Python 3.11 specified
- âœ… Optimized package sources
- âœ… Backward compatible with requirements.txt

**requirements.txt** (Fallback):
- âœ… Exact match with course requirements
- âœ… Additional project dependencies
- âœ… Works with pip/venv

## Next Steps for You

1. **Choose Your Method**:
   - **Recommended**: Mamba (`./scripts/install/setup-mamba.sh`)
   - **Alternative**: Pip (`./scripts/install/setup-venv.sh` after Python upgrade)

2. **Run Setup**:
   - Follow commands in `SETUP_README.md`
   - Or use automated scripts

3. **Configure API Keys**:
   - Create `.env` file
   - Add OpenAI, Tavily, etc.

4. **Start Learning**:
   - Follow `docs/AGENTIC_ROADMAP.md`
   - Run course notebooks
   - Experiment with agents

## Why This Approach?

### You Asked About Mamba

> "I'd like to use mamba to manage the libraries if possible. Using requirements.txt seems to be outdated but we can still keep it for backward compatibility."

5. **Professional**: Industry best practices

## Conclusion

Your environment is now set up with:
- âœ… Modern mamba/conda support (primary)
