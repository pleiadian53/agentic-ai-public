"""
High-level orchestration helpers for the chart reflection workflow.

This package exposes the core entry point `run_reflection_workflow` along with
dataclasses that describe the workflow inputs and outputs.  The modules within
the package are intentionally small so they can be composed or swapped out when
building custom agent pipelines.
