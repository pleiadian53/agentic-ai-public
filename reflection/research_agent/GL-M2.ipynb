    "## 🧠 Graded Lab: Reflection in a Research Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "In this graded lab, you’ll implement a simple **agentic workflow** designed to simulate reflective thinking in a writing task. This is one building block of a more complex research agent that will be constructed throughout the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📘 Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a three-step workflow where an LLM writes an essay draft, critiques it, and rewrites it. The focus of the lab is not on the content quality of the essay, but rather on how you orchestrate the **calls to the LLM** and pass intermediate results between steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ What You’ll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Step 1 – Drafting:** Call the LLM to generate an initial draft of an essay based on a simple prompt.\n",
    "* **Step 2 – Reflection:** Reflect on the draft using a reasoning step. (Optionally, this can be done with a different model.)\n",
    "* **Step 3 – Revision:** Apply the feedback from the reflection to generate a revised version of the essay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Assessment Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll be graded based on how well you implement the agent functions. The grading is focused on **code correctness**, not the essay content. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each function should:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Successfully make a call to the LLM.\n",
    "  2. Return the correct **type** of output (e.g., a string).\n",
    "* The full workflow should:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Successfully execute end-to-end.\n",
    "  * Maintain consistent structure and data flow across steps."
