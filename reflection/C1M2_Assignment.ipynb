    "Build a three-step workflow where an LLM writes an essay draft, critiques it, and rewrites it. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Step 1 – Drafting:** Call the LLM to generate an initial draft of an essay based on a simple prompt.\n",
    "* **Step 2 – Reflection:** Reflect on the draft using a reasoning step. (Optionally, this can be done with a different model.)\n",
    "* **Step 3 – Revision:** Apply the feedback from the reflection to generate a revised version of the essay.\n"
