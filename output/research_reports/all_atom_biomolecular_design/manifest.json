      "context": "Focus on 2025 breakthroughs, unsolved problems in all-atom molecular design. \nPrioritize: RFdiffusion3's unified all-atom framework (proteins, DNA, RNA, ligands), Boltz-2's structure-affinity co-prediction (20 seconds, GPU-based), AlphaFold3's multi-component complexes. \n\nInclude: Diffusion model architectures, sparse attention mechanisms, atom-level conditioning (H-bonds, solvent accessibility), training on PDB + AlphaFold data, experimental validation results, 10x speed improvements over RFdiffusion2, drug discovery timeline reductions (42\u219218 months), comparison with physics-based FEP calculations. Emphasize technical methods, model architectures, and computational efficiency.",
