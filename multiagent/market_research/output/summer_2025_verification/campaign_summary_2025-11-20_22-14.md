# 🕶️ Summer Sunglasses Campaign – Executive Summary

## 📊 Refined Trend Insights
**Trend Scan (Sources: Byrdie, “10 Summer 2025 Sunglasses Trends,” and Vogue Scandinavia, “2025 Eyewear Trends”):**  
1. **Tinted/Color-Blocked Lenses & Sculptural Shapes** – Byrdie emphasizes a palette of saturated shades—think millennial pink and other boldly hued lenses—juxtaposed with classic forms (oval, geometric) elevated by sculptural finishes.  
2. **’90s Retro Classics (Aviators, Wayfarers, Cat-Eyes)** – Both outlets highlight the revival of iconic silhouettes, with Vogue Scandinavia calling out Aviators, Wayfarers, and cat-eye/oval shapes rendered in luxe gold-tone and acetate executions.  
3. **Sporty Wraps & Minimal Tech-Inspired Frames** – Vogue Scandinavia notes an appetite for wraparound lenses and pared-back metal designs that bridge performance and modernist sensibilities for active summer moments.

**Catalog Alignment:**  
- **Aviator (SG001)** – A lightweight metal teardrop that mirrors the retro-meets-modern narrative and pairs effortlessly with the trend for tinted, statement lenses.  
- **Wayfarer (SG002)** – Bold acetate construction and angular edges align with the ’90s revival of assertive, square proportions.  
- **Mystique (SG003)** – A refined cat-eye interpretation that captures the elevated glamour and feminine lift featured in the trend coverage.  
- **Sport (SG004)** – Wraparound form and functional detailing respond directly to the sporty, tech-forward direction emerging for summer.

**Recommendation:**  
Position Aviator (SG001) and Wayfarer (SG002) as the core summer sunglasses drop to reflect the strongest alignment with current retro, tinted, and oversized runway cues. Layer in Mystique (SG003) to satisfy the demand for elevated cat-eye glamour, and Sport (SG004) to serve the athleisure/tech-aware audience. This curated quartet delivers breadth in silhouette and utility while keeping product availability and promotional readiness at the forefront.
