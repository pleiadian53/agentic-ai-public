            <h2>Key Concepts</h2>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>Quantum Bits (Qubits)</h3>
                <p>In quantum computing, the basic unit of information is the qubit. Unlike classical bits that can be either 0 or 1, a qubit can exist in superpositions of states, enabling it to be 0, 1, or both simultaneously. This property is a foundational aspect that contributes to the potential power of quantum computers.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>Quantum Entanglement</h3>
                <p>Entanglement is a quantum phenomenon where two or more qubits become linked, such that the state of one qubit directly affects the state of the other, regardless of distance. Entanglement is crucial for many quantum algorithms and allows for phenomena like quantum teleportation and superdense coding.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>Quantum Superposition</h3>
                <p>Superposition refers to a qubit's ability to exist in multiple states at once. This principle allows quantum computers to perform many calculations simultaneously, providing exponential speed-up potential compared to classical computers for certain problems.</p>
