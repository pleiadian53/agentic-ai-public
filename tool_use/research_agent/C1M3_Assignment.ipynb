    "# Graded Lab : Tool Use and Reflective Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore how AI agents can enhance research workflows by leveraging external tools and engaging in critical self-reflection. You'll learn how to build and integrate callable tools—such as web and academic search functions, and connect them to a language model using OpenAI's tool-calling API. Then, you’ll guide the agent to not only generate content but also **reflect** on its own output, improving the quality and depth of the final report. By the end of this lab, you will have implemented a mini agent capable of searching, reasoning, and publishing structured reports in HTML—laying the foundation for more advanced multi-step and autonomous AI systems."

The sum of matrices is determined by the sum in F-algebra, and the product of matrices is determined by the product of mappings. The system of equations, whose matrix is a matrix of mappings, is called a system of additive equations. I considered the methods of solving system of additive equations. As an example, I consider the solution of a system of linear equations over the complex field provided that the equations contain unknown quantities and their conjugates.\\n  Linear mappings of algebra over a commutative ring preserve the operation of addition in algebra and the product of elements of the algebra by elements of the ring.

      "### Overview of Climate Change Impacts on Coral Reefs\n",
      "\n",
      "Coral reefs are among the ecosystems most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. They are subjected to several stressors arising from changes in climatic conditions, which collectively threaten their survival. Key impacts include increased ocean temperatures, ocean acidification due to elevated carbon dioxide levels, and severe weather events. These factors contribute significantly to coral bleaching and mortality, posing a significant threat to these ecosystems and the biodiversity they support.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Impacts of Climate Change\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Coral Bleaching**: Rising sea surface temperatures are the primary cause of coral bleaching, a phenomenon where corals expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, leading to a white appearance and a higher susceptibility to mortality [IUCN](https://iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/coral-reefs-and-climate-change), [PDF Report by Coral Reef Alliance](https://www.coral.org/files/pdf/breifs/climatechange.pdf).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Ocean Acidification**: Increased atmospheric CO2 from fossil fuels results in higher CO2 concentrations in the ocean, leading to ocean acidification. This process weakens coral skeletons and hinders calcification, which is essential for coral growth [Pew Center Report](https://www.c2es.org/document/coral-reefs-global-climate-change-potential-contributions-of-climate-change-to-stresses-on-coral-reef-ecosystems/).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Severe Weather Events**: Climate change leads to more frequent and intense storms, which physically damage coral reefs. Altered storm patterns also affect the ecosystems around these reefs [Coral Reef Alliance Report](https://www.coral.org/files/pdf/breifs/climatechange.pdf).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Socioeconomic Impacts\n",
      "\n",
      "The degradation of coral reef ecosystems due to climate change carries significant economic consequences. Estimates suggest that coral reef degradation could result in economic losses of US $5 to 14 million annually by 2050, affecting fisheries, tourism, and coastal protection [Coral Reef Alliance Report](https://www.coral.org/files/pdf/breifs/climatechange.pdf).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Mitigation and Adaptation\n",
      "\n",
      "Preservation efforts focus on limiting global average temperature rise as outlined in the Paris Agreement, aiming to keep it well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, with efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C offering the best chance for the survival of coral reefs globally [IUCN](https://iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/coral-reefs-and-climate-change). Establishing marine protected areas and reducing local stressors like pollution and overfishing further supports reef resilience [Pew Center Report](https://www.c2es.org/document/coral-reefs-global-climate-change-potential-contributions-of-climate-change-to-stresses-on-coral-reef-ecosystems/).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Coral reefs face a perilous future under business-as-usual greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Concerted global efforts to reduce emissions and local conservation strategies are crucial in mitigating the impacts of climate change on these critical marine ecosystems. For more resources on this topic, [IUCN](https://iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/coral-reefs-and-climate-change) and the [Great Barrier Reef Foundation](https://www.barrierreef.org/the-reef/threats/climate-change) offer comprehensive insights into initiatives and research.\n"

      "## Radio Observations of Recurrent Novae\n",
      "\n",
      "Recurrent novae are a fascinating subclass of novae that undergo multiple outbursts due to the accumulation and subsequent nuclear ignition of material on the surface of a white dwarf. Radio observations of these events provide critical insights into the dynamics of the outburst, the interaction with the surrounding medium, and the physics of the ejection processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. RS Ophiuchi Observations\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Low-frequency Observations\n",
      "The recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi has been extensively observed in the radio spectrum, particularly during its 2021 outburst. Studies using instruments like MeerKAT and LOFAR have interpreted the radio emissions as synchrotron radiation resulting from the interaction between the nova ejecta and the circumbinary medium. The details of these observations provide valuable data on the shock interactions and their evolution over time [Inspire HEP](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2626516).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### First Radio Detection\n",
      "RS Ophiuchi was also notable for providing the first radio detection of a recurrent nova outburst. The observed brightness temperature was much higher than that typically seen in classical novae, suggesting a non-thermal origin for the radio emissions, likely due to shock-induced synchrotron radiation [Nature Article](https://www.nature.com/articles/315306a0).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. T Pyxidis Observations\n",
      "\n",
      "The recurrent nova T Pyxidis experienced a notable outburst in 2011, which was subject to radio observations aimed at evaluating the ejecta mass and examining the complexity of the mass loss mechanisms. These studies offered insights into the changes in ejection profiles between different outbursts and helped to refine models of nova evolution [ADS Harvard](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...785...78N).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. General Characteristics of Radio Emission in Recurrent Novae\n",
      "\n",
      "Low-frequency radio observations reveal that the nova ejecta are often initially optically thick, with radio light curves showing a characteristic rise. This behavior helps astrophysicists determine key parameters such as the ejecta mass and velocity, contributing to our understanding of the physical processes at work during nova outbursts [MNRAS](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/523/1/132/7159730).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Radio observations of recurrent novae like RS Ophiuchi and T Pyxidis provide a window into the dramatic and energetic events that characterize these systems. Future observations, particularly with next-generation radio telescopes, will likely continue to enhance our understanding of these astrophysical phenomena, helping to unravel the complexities of accretion, ejection, and interaction with the interstellar medium.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. Configure the Response Call\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**: Use the specified model (e.g., `\"gpt-4o-mini\"`) and set the temperature equal to the `temperature` parameter of the graded function.\n",
    "- **Structure**: Make sure the response setup directs the model properly, ensuring the JSON format is adhered to without additional commentary.\n",

Researchers have applied CRISPR to knockout or decrease the expression of specific proteins in immune cells, such as PD-1 in T-cells, to enhance their ability to target and kill cancer cells. This approach is essential in developing more effective cancer immunotherapies [source](https://molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12943-023-01925-5).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Genetic Disease Correction**: The CRISPR/Cas9 system demonstrates significant potential in correcting genetic mutations responsible for various hereditary diseases. For instance, the technology has been used to correct mutations in the BRCA1 gene, potentially offering new avenues for treating conditions like hereditary breast and ovarian cancer [source](https://molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12943-023-01925-5).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Gene Therapy**: CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to modify DNA, either by disrupting faulty genes or by inserting new sequences, to treat genetic disorders. This genome-editing capability offers the potential to treat monogenic disorders and other complex genetic diseases by directly altering the genetic underpinnings [source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235230422300079X).\n",

       "1. **Crop Improvement**: CRISPR technology is employed to edit plant genomes to improve traits such as yield, nutritional content, and resistance to pests and diseases. This targeted approach in plant biotechnology could help address food security challenges by producing more resilient crops [source](https://harvardonline.harvard.edu/course/crispr-gene-editing-applications).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Sustainable Agriculture**: By enabling precise genetic modifications, CRISPR can be applied to reduce the need for chemical pesticides and fertilizers, thus promoting more sustainable agricultural practices. These applications have the potential to minimize environmental impacts while maintaining productivity [source](https://crisprtx.com/gene-editing).\n",
       "\n",
       "### Industrial and Biotechnological Applications\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Bioengineering and Synthetic Biology**: CRISPR is used to alter microbial genomes for industrial processes, including the production of biofuels, pharmaceuticals, and other valuable compounds. By modifying specific metabolic pathways, researchers can optimize microbial factories to be more efficient and less costly [source](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10916045/).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Nanotechnology**: Although still emerging, CRISPR's integration with nanotechnology holds promise for targeted drug delivery systems and advanced gene regulation approaches.

      "### Overview of Radio Observations of Recurrent Novae\n",
      "\n",
      "Radio observations of recurrent novae play an essential role in understanding the physical processes occurring during and after nova outbursts. These outbursts result from thermonuclear explosions on the surface of a white dwarf in a binary system, leading to the ejection of material. The radio regime helps probe these violent events by enabling the study of synchrotron radiation and interactions with surrounding media.\n",

      "#### Key Studies and Results\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **RS Ophiuchi 2021 Outburst:**\n",
      "   - One significant recent study involves low-frequency radio observations of the 2021 outburst of RS Ophiuchi. These observations were conducted with the MeerKAT and LOFAR telescopes. The radio emission is understood as synchrotron radiation resulting from the shock interaction between nova ejecta and the circumbinary medium [INSPIREHEP](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2626516).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **T Pyx 2011 Outburst:**\n",
      "   - Another important case is the 2011 outburst of recurrent nova T Pyx. Radio observations provided insights into the mass of the ejected material and suggested complex mass loss processes. Such data are invaluable for modeling the mass transfer dynamics in these systems [Astrophysics Data System](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...785...78N).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Historical Perspectives:**\n",
      "   - RS Ophiuchi was also the first recurrent nova whose outburst was detected in the radio spectrum. This groundbreaking observation suggested a non-thermal origin for the radio emission, contrasting with classical novae [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/315306a0).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **General Insights:**\n",
      "   - The broader understanding of radio emissions from novae, including recurrent and classical novae, dates back several decades. Initial radio signatures were interpreted as thermal free-free emission, but contemporary studies often reveal more intricate processes involving synchrotron and non-thermal emissions [IOP Science](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ac24ab/pdf).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Radio observations provide a critical window into the behavior and characteristics of recurrent novae. By examining the strength, timing, and spectrum of radio emissions, astronomers can infer properties of the nova such as ejecta mass, velocity, and interactions with the surrounding medium. Continued advancements in radio astronomy promise to further unveil the complexities of these fascinating stellar events.\n",
